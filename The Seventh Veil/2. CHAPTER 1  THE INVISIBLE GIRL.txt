# CHAPTER 1: THE INVISIBLE GIRL

## Setting the Scene
- **Present Day London**: Gray skies hang over a sprawling city of contrasts—gleaming skyscrapers alongside Victorian architecture, wealth beside poverty.
- **Foswick House**: A three-story brick Victorian home in a modest East London neighborhood, converted into a foster home. Paint peeling from the windowsills, a small fenced yard with patchy grass, interior that smells of bleach and microwaved meals.
- **Season/Time**: Six months after the prologue. Early June, when London should be warming but stubbornly refuses. Eliza's last day of school before summer holiday—typically a time of dread rather than excitement for foster children.

## Introducing Eliza
- **Physical Description**: Twelve-year-old Eliza Gray is small for her age with sharp features, observant hazel eyes, and dark hair usually tucked under a weathered gray beanie. She wears layers regardless of weather—a defense mechanism to hide her body and the strange mark on her shoulder.
- **Personal Items**: Everything she owns fits in a battered blue backpack with faded superhero patches. Most precious possession: a small smooth stone with natural markings resembling a seven-pointed star, found the morning after her encounter with Jin Wei. She doesn't remember the encounter clearly but keeps the stone as a good luck charm.
- **Character Traits**: Hypervigilant, resourceful, and fiercely independent. Speaks rarely but observes everything. Has trained herself to go unnoticed—a skill that serves her well in the foster system but occasionally fails in inexplicable ways.

## Daily Life at Foswick House
- **The System**: Detailed portrayal of life in the London foster care system—weekly social worker visits, the economics of fostering, the hierarchy among children.
- **Current Guardians**: Mrs. Penney, a chronically exhausted widow who runs the home less out of compassion and more as a means of income. Mr. Gaines, her partner who handles maintenance and discipline with cold efficiency.
- **Fellow Foster Children**: Five others sharing the home, including:
  - Darren, 16, the domineering alpha who controls the house's social hierarchy
  - Maddie, 14, who maintains her status by aligning with Darren
  - Twins Owen and Oliver, 10, relatively new arrivals who stick together
  - Sophie, 7, the youngest, who has taken to following Eliza despite her attempts to remain distant

## The Morning Routine
- **Waking**: Eliza rises before the others to secure bathroom time and avoid confrontation. She has precisely 4 minutes and 26 seconds to shower before hot water runs out.
- **The Mark**: Private moment where Eliza examines the strange mark on her shoulder—a faint silver pattern like a partial snowflake or seven-pointed star. Some days it's barely visible; on others (especially when she's upset), it seems to shimmer just beneath her skin.
- **The Dream**: Recollection of a recurring dream—an old man with glowing hands speaking in a language she shouldn't understand but somehow does: "When the time comes, you will know. The Seventh Veil waits for you alone."

## School Life
- **Academic Performance**: Despite changing schools frequently, Eliza maintains surprisingly good grades—not from ambition but from using books and learning as escape.
- **Social Isolation**: Deliberately keeps to herself, eating lunch alone, avoiding group activities. Teachers see her as "the quiet one" and rarely notice her special abilities in art class, where she instinctively draws intricate patterns similar to her shoulder mark.
- **The Teacher**: Ms. Harlow, an art teacher who has shown unusual interest in Eliza's drawings and seems to sometimes stare at her with an intensity that makes Eliza uncomfortable.

## Strange Occurrences
- **Pattern of Incidents**: Establish a history of unexplainable events that Eliza has learned to hide or dismiss:
  - Lightbulbs that flicker or burst when she's frightened
  - The time Sophie's scraped knee stopped bleeding after Eliza instinctively touched it
  - Books that seem to fall from shelves exactly when she needs information
  - The recurring phenomenon where locks sometimes click open at her touch

- **Physical Manifestations**: When emotionally triggered, the mark on her shoulder warms, and for brief moments, faint silver-blue patterns appear on her skin like spreading frost before quickly fading.
- **Coping Mechanisms**: Eliza has developed strategies to conceal these occurrences—wearing long sleeves regardless of weather, controlling her emotions, creating logical explanations for the inexplicable.

## The Last Day of School
- **Morning Conflict**: At breakfast, Darren steals Eliza's portion as a show of power. When she protests, a glass inexplicably shatters. Mrs. Penney blames Eliza despite it being across the room.
- **School Atmosphere**: End-of-term excitement pervades her middle school. Teachers distracted, students rowdy, everyone making summer plans that highlight Eliza's isolation.
- **The Art Class**: Ms. Harlow asks students to draw "what makes you special." While others sketch talents or family scenes, Eliza unconsciously draws an intricate pattern resembling her shoulder mark but more complete.
- **The Observation**: Ms. Harlow passes behind Eliza, gasps softly at the drawing, and whispers, "Impossible..." Before hurrying away, she appears to send a text message while glancing nervously at Eliza.

## The News
- **Social Worker Visit**: Mrs. Chapman, Eliza's weary social worker, arrives after school with news—Eliza is being transferred to a new foster placement across town. No explanation given, just paperwork and a weekend deadline.
- **The Reaction**: Outwardly stoic, Eliza has learned not to show attachment to places or people. Inwardly, a sense of panic rises—this home, though far from perfect, has been stable for almost a year.
- **The Warning Signs**: As her emotions rise, the lights in the room flicker noticeably. Her shoulder begins to burn beneath her sweater. Mrs. Chapman doesn't notice, but Mrs. Penney eyes her suspiciously.

## The Packing
- **The Process**: Eliza methodically packs her few possessions, including carefully hidden treasures—her star stone, a library book on ancient symbols she's neglected to return, a small sketchbook filled with the strange patterns that come to her mind.
- **The Confrontation**: Sophie comes to say goodbye, bringing a friendship bracelet. Their moment is interrupted by Darren and Maddie, who mock the gesture and demand to see what "weird stuff" Eliza is packing.
- **The Escalation**: When Darren grabs Eliza's backpack and dumps it out, her precious stone falls to the floor. He picks it up, taunting her, refusing to return it despite Sophie's pleas.

## The Incident
- **The Breaking Point**: As Darren holds the stone above his head, something in Eliza snaps. The fear of losing her only treasured possession overcomes years of careful emotional control.
- **The Manifestation**: The mark on her shoulder burns white-hot. Silver-blue patterns momentarily race across her visible skin. The air in the room seems to compress.
- **The Pulse**: Without understanding how, Eliza feels something surge through her body and outward like an invisible wave. Darren and Maddie are thrown backward as if hit by a powerful gust, landing several feet away. The stone drops to the floor, unharmed.
- **The Aftermath**: The room falls silent. Sophie stares wide-eyed. Darren and Maddie look genuinely frightened. Nobody can explain what just happened, but they all felt it. Eliza herself is most shocked of all.

## The Witness
- **The Observer**: Through the window, from across the street, a woman watches intently. Tall, elegant, with dark hair streaked with silver. She wears a long coat despite the warm day, but as she raises her hand to her mouth in surprise, her sleeve falls back revealing intricate, shifting patterns on her forearm.
- **The Recognition**: The woman's eyes lock with Eliza's for a brief, electric moment. Unlike everyone else who has ever looked at Eliza, this woman seems to truly see her—and understand exactly what just happened.
- **The Decision**: As shouts echo from downstairs—Mrs. Penney demanding to know what happened—the woman across the street pulls out a phone and makes a call, her eyes never leaving Eliza.

## Chapter Close
- **The Consequence**: Mrs. Penney bursts in, finds the chaos, assumes Eliza physically attacked the others. Announces she's calling Mrs. Chapman to have Eliza removed immediately, not waiting for the weekend.
- **The Realization**: As Eliza is marched downstairs, she glances back out the window. The mysterious woman is gone, but Eliza feels something has fundamentally changed. The mark on her shoulder has gone from warm to a pleasant cool sensation, as if finally acknowledged.
- **The Foreshadowing**: As she's lectured in the kitchen, waiting for Mrs. Chapman to return, Eliza notices the morning paper Mrs. Penney was reading. A small article mentions police seeking information about an elderly Asian man who escaped from custody six months ago. The grainy photo shows a face Eliza recognizes from her dreams.
