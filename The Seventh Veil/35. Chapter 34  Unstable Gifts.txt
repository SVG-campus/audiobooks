# Chapter 34: Unstable Gifts

## Opening Scene
The chapter opens on a cargo ship crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Eliza stands alone on the deck at night, studying her reflection in a small mirror by moonlight. Her tattoos have now spread across half her body in an asymmetrical pattern—beautiful but unsettling. When she experiences strong emotions, tendrils of ink move beneath her skin, occasionally extending beyond the existing patterns. In the cramped cabin below, Theo and Darius sleep fitfully, both bearing minor burns from when Eliza's powers surged during a nightmare the previous night.

## The Growing Danger
- Three weeks have passed since their escape from Blackwell's compound
- Eliza demonstrates significantly increased abilities but with diminishing control
- A flashback shows a market incident where her anger at a thief caused nearby glass to shatter
- Darius attempts to teach her meditation techniques, but her connection to the Veil is fundamentally different
- Theo bears a handprint-shaped mark on his arm where Eliza grabbed him during a power surge

## The Stowaway Connection
- The trio discovers they're not alone in hiding on the ship
- A young woman named Malika reveals herself—she bears a single, unusual Veil tattoo
- Malika explains she's fleeing Covenant persecution after her entire family was captured
- She recognizes what Eliza is becoming and shares folklore about previous Seventh Veil attempts
- Eliza forms an immediate connection with her, the first person who doesn't seem afraid of her growing power

## The Night Terror
- That night, Eliza experiences her most violent nightmare yet
- In the dream, Blackwell speaks directly to her, appearing as a mentor rather than enemy
- He shows her visions of her unleashed power destroying everything she touches
- He offers an alternative—his guidance to prevent catastrophe
- Eliza wakes to find herself hovering above her bunk, the cabin's metal fixtures warped around her

## The Close Call
- The ship's crew investigates the disturbance, threatening their secrecy
- Darius uses his limited Veil abilities to distract the sailors
- Theo must physically restrain Eliza as her powers continue to fluctuate
- Malika reveals her Veil specialty—a rare ability to temporarily suppress other Veils
- She helps stabilize Eliza but warns the effect is temporary and growing less effective

## The Harbor Incident
- The ship docks in Athens, where they plan to find passage to Asia
- Covenant agents are waiting, having tracked Eliza's magical signature
- During the ensuing confrontation, Eliza attempts to use her powers defensively
- Her control slips, creating a devastating energy wave that injures everyone nearby, including innocent bystanders
- Horrified by what she's done, Eliza flees into the city while her friends are still recovering

## The Watershed Moment
- Eliza hides in an ancient temple, her tattoos pulsing with power she can't contain
- She experiences a vision—not from Blackwell, but seemingly from the Seventh Veil itself
- The vision shows her two paths: continue with her friends and risk their lives, or seek the remaining trials alone
- She sees flashes of possible futures where Darius and Theo die trying to protect her from herself
- The vision ends with a glimpse of her fully transformed, the complete Seventh Veil covering her entire body

## The Reluctant Decision
- Darius, Theo, and Malika find Eliza at the temple
- Eliza demonstrates a new ability—creating a perfect barrier between herself and her friends
- Through the barrier, she explains her decision to continue alone
- Darius argues passionately against this, revealing his deep feelings for her
- Theo understands but offers an alternative—Rivera might know how to stabilize her powers

## The Painful Farewell
- Eliza considers their suggestion but another power surge decides for her
- The surge causes ancient temple columns to crack, nearly crushing Malika
- Using her new abilities, Eliza creates a perfect duplicate of Madame Vesper's journal for her friends
- She leaves them specific instructions to find Rivera while she continues to Japan
- As she departs, she kisses Darius through the barrier, transferring a fraction of her power to him—a protective measure she doesn't fully understand herself

## Chapter Closing
The chapter concludes with Eliza on a different ship bound for Asia. She stands on the deck, her tattoos now slightly dimmed after transferring some power to Darius. She can sense Blackwell recovering his strength, pursuing her across continents. In a moment of clarity, she realizes she's caught between two forces—Blackwell's hunger for the Seventh Veil and the Veil's own mysterious agenda that seems to be reshaping her from within. She watches the European coastline disappear, wondering if she'll ever see her friends again or if the person they know will even exist after the Veil's completion. As night falls, she deliberately enters a meditative state, inviting Blackwell into her dreams—not to surrender, but to learn more about the power transforming her while keeping him distracted from her friends' location.
