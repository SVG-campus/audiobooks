# Chapter 28: Shadows Across Europe

## Opening Scene
- **Setting**: A nighttime border crossing between Germany and Austria
- **Characters**: Eliza, Rivera, Darius, a recovering Theo, and their new ally Linnea
- **Atmosphere**: Tense, furtive, with the constant threat of detection

## Plot Elements

### The Border Crossing
- The group uses forged documents procured through Linnea's local connections
- Rivera creates a subtle glamour using her Veils to make them appear as an ordinary family
- Border guards have been provided with descriptions of "persons of interest" by individuals in dark suits
- Eliza notices her tattoo becoming warm when near the guards, reacting to something unseen
- Theo, still weak but conscious, uses minimal Passage Veil abilities to blur their presence just enough to get through

### Covenant's Widening Net
- After clearing the border, Darius reveals intelligence from his underground contacts
- Digital displays in the train station briefly flash with their faces before returning to normal schedules
- News reports of "dangerous cult members" match their descriptions
- The Covenant is using both magical and conventional methods to track them, including influence over governmental authorities

### The Train Journey
- The group boards a night train headed southeast toward Istanbul
- Eliza notices a passenger with a partially concealed tattoo watching them
- Confined space of the train creates tension and paranoia
- Linnea uses her Crafting Veil to create wooden tokens that help mask their magical signatures

### Eliza's Growing Powers
- In the privacy of their compartment, Eliza practices controlling her new abilities
- She can now sense the composition of objects through touch (Element Veil)
- With concentration, she can make minor alterations to simple objects (Crafting Veil)
- The powers work better in tandem than separately, suggesting the Seventh Veil's integrative nature
- First signs of power addiction—Eliza feels a rush when using her abilities that she begins to crave

### Unexpected Ally
- The suspicious passenger confronts them in the dining car
- Reveals himself as Mikhail, a former Covenant archivist who defected
- He recognized Eliza's partially completed Seventh Veil pattern from ancient texts
- Offers critical information about Istanbul in exchange for protection
- Trust issues arise as the group debates whether to believe him

## Midpoint Crisis
- Train makes an unscheduled stop in a small Hungarian town
- Covenant agents board the train, methodically searching compartments
- The group is forced to quickly abandon their belongings and flee
- Mikhail knows a safe house nearby, but following him requires trusting a stranger

### The Safe House
- Mikhail leads them to an abandoned clocktower on the edge of town
- The building is protected by old Veil magic—a forgotten Covenant outpost now used by defectors
- Inside they find supplies, maps, and communication equipment
- Mikhail explains the network of Covenant deserters that exists across Europe
- First mention of "The Unbounded"—a counter-organization to the Covenant

### Mikhail's Warning
- While the others rest, Mikhail shares critical information with Eliza and Rivera
- Istanbul's site is heavily monitored by the Covenant; the Sight Veil shrine is beneath Hagia Sophia
- The Covenant doesn't know the exact location but has agents throughout the city
- More importantly, he warns that the Seventh Veil is changing Eliza faster than expected
- Historical records show previous attempts at creating the Seventh Veil resulted in the bearer losing their humanity

### Eliza's Dreams
- That night, Eliza experiences her most vivid dream yet
- She sees through the eyes of Felix and Ash, imprisoned in the Covenant headquarters
- Witnesses Blackwell performing experiments on captured Veil-bearers
- Glimpses Blackwell's own extensive tattoos—he bears five of the six known Veils
- Wakes with the ability to draw a detailed map of the Covenant headquarters from memory

## Climactic Sequence
- Dawn brings the sound of pursuit—Covenant agents have tracked them to the town
- The group splits up to create confusion—Eliza and Theo go with Mikhail while Rivera, Darius, and Linnea create a diversion
- During the chaos, Eliza instinctively combines her Element and Crafting Veils to animate wooden figures as decoys
- The unexpected power surge causes her tattoo to burn painfully and spread slightly further down her arm

### The Confrontation
- Mikhail leads Eliza and Theo to a hidden underground passage
- They're intercepted by two Covenant agents with Sight and Passage Veils
- Theo is still too weak to use his Passage Veil effectively
- Eliza must defend them without Rivera's guidance for the first time

### The Power Surge
- Cornered and desperate, Eliza taps deeply into her incomplete Seventh Veil
- Time seems to slow as her perception heightens
- She finds she can sense the agents' Veils and disrupt their patterns momentarily
- The disruptive ability works but causes her tattoo to burn painfully and spread further
- Eliza subdues the agents but nearly loses control in the process

## Closing Scene
- The group reunites at a predetermined location outside town
- Rivera is alarmed by the further spread of Eliza's tattoo without a formal trial
- Mikhail confirms this is a warning sign—the Seventh Veil is developing too quickly
- Darius secures transportation to Istanbul through his contacts
- Eliza reveals her dream-vision of the Covenant headquarters and Felix and Ash's condition
- The chapter ends with Eliza catching her reflection in a window, noticing her eyes briefly flashing with an otherworldly light—a sign of the Sight Veil awakening prematurely within her
- Final dialogue: Mikhail warns that Istanbul's trial will be more dangerous than anything they've faced—"The Sight Veil doesn't just let you see the world; it lets the world beyond see you."

## Themes and Symbolism
- The train journey represents the transitional phase Eliza is experiencing
- The clocktower safe house symbolizes the running out of time
- Eliza's increasingly vivid dreams foreshadow her developing connection to the Sight Veil
- The spreading tattoo visualizes the growing influence of the Veils on Eliza's being

## Character Development
- Eliza shows more confidence in her abilities but also the first signs of being changed by them
- Rivera grows increasingly concerned about Eliza's accelerated development
- Theo demonstrates resilience as he slowly recovers while still contributing to the group
- Darius reveals more of his extensive underground connections
- Linnea provides a grounding influence, reminding them of the traditional ways of the Veils
- Mikhail adds complexity to the Covenant portrayal, showing that not all members agree with Blackwell's methods
